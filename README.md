## General info 

"Faculty student service" is my first php project, created during the first steps of learning procedural programming,
data validation, CRUD functionality, database interaction and users login. 

During the enrollment of students for the new school year, the user(admin) can enter his data, has the ability to search for
registered students, has insight into the passed subjects and grades, as well as insight into the student's financial obligation to the faculty..
